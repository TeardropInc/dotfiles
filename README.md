# Dot files

A mixture of tips that have been refactored into [thoughtbot's implementation](https://github.com/thoughtbot/dotfiles).

## Setup New Computer
`git clone git@github.com:adr-enal-in/dotfiles.git ~/.dot-files && ~/.dot-files/install.sh`

## Install Vim Bundles
`vim +BundleInstall +qall`
Or inside Vim with `:BundleInstall`
